# Open Source Contributions
I've focused on contributing directly to any OSS documentation that I use.  I follow the "find it, fix it" mentality, and to leave something better for others after me.

You can see my PRs [here](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asamhrncir+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed)!

I have extensive understanding of OSS contribution through my Senior Capstone and continuing education.
